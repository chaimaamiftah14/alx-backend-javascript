This is a small presentation for this project
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this project, you'll create a 'Student' interface with properties like 'firstName', 'lastName', 'age', and 'location', then render a table displaying each student's name and location using Vanilla JavaScript. You'll build a 'Teacher' interface with required and optional attributes, allowing for additional unspecified properties, and extend this to a 'Directors' interface. You'll also implement a 'StudentClass' with methods for displaying the student's name and indicating homework progress. For more advanced types, you'll create 'DirectorInterface' and 'TeacherInterface' with specific work-related methods and classes that implement these interfaces. Additionally, you'll write functions to handle employee roles, define string literal types for subjects, and manage CRUD operations on student data using ambient namespaces. Finally, you'll merge declarations for teaching subjects and introduce brand conventions in TypeScript to distinguish between major and minor credits, summing them accordingly.
